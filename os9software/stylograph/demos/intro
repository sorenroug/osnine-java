It allows you to type text on a video terminal, modifying and correcting it as you go, and then print it out when the complete text is finished. The STYLOGRAPH system is cursor-orientated with dynamic screen formatting. Cursor-based editing means that you may work on any portion of the text by moving the cursor to that point. Dynamic screen formatting means that the text is formatted on the screen in the same way it will appear on the printed copy. The display is continuously updated to show you how the text will appear. This is a very important feature normally available only on very expensive commercial word processing systems. It significantly reduces the time that it takes to produce finished copy.,pp≥F≥U≥L≥L≥ ≥F≥E≥A≥T≥U≥R≥E≥ ≥T≥E≥X≥T≥ ≥E≥D≥I≥T≥I≥N≥GThere is a full array of commands to help in the creation and modification of the text. The text displayed on the screen may be moved up, down, left or right. Also, the cursor can be moved to any page or to any specified series of letters or words. The cursor itself can be moved left, right, up, down, to any tab position, or to the extreme left or right. Any block of text can be moved, copied or deleted. You may also do a global replace so that all occurrences of a given string will be replaced with or without a "prompt" asking you if you wish the item replaced.,pp≥O≥P≥E≥R≥A≥T≥O≥R≥ ≥C≥O≥N≥V≥E≥N≥I≥E≥N≥C≥EAt the beginning of the text, the operator normally types in a few simple commands indicating the line length, left margin, and so forth, and then enters the header and footer as they should appear. After that point the operator need not worry about the formatting of the page since it is taken care of automatically. Words that extend beyond the end of the line are automatically removed and placed on the next line. Headers and footers are also automatically inserted so that the operator always knows what portion of the page is being worked on. Ghost hyphens can also be entered so that if the word falls at the end of a line, and a ghost hyphen has been inserted, the hyphen will automatically be added.,pp≥F≥L≥E≥X≥I≥B≥L≥E≥ ≥D≥I≥S≥P≥L≥A≥YA command allows you to view the formatting commands or make them disappear from the screen. Another command allows you to see which characters will be modified at printout by underlining, superscripting, boldface, and so forth. A page status command allows you to see the current format values and other useful information.,pp≥C≥O≥M≥P≥L≥E≥T≥E≥ ≥F≥O≥R≥M≥A≥T≥T≥I≥N≥G≥ ≥C≥O≥N≥T≥R≥O≥LThe text or individual lines may be centred, left justified, right justified, or right and left justified. Tabs can be set or cleared at any point. Spacing of the lines on the text is under complete operator control with end of page, spacing, and vertical tab commands.,pp≥P≥O≥W≥E≥R≥F≥U≥L≥ ≥P≥R≥I≥N≥T≥I≥N≥G≥ ≥O≥P≥T≥I≥O≥N≥SUnderlining is supported by TTY type printers. For those people who have speciality printers there are a variety of additional capabilities including:,nl 10                     operator controllable pitch                     1.5 line spacing                     ≥B≥O≥L≥D≥F≥A≥C≥E                     superscript¡1                     subscript·2                     ≤u≤n≤d≤e≤r≤l≤i≤n≤e, µoµvµeµrµlµiµnµeAlso right and left justification of text is accomplished by incremental printing and true proportional spacing is supported on the specialty printers.,pp≥O≥P≥E≥R≥A≥T≥I≥N≥G≥ ≥S≥Y≥S≥T≥E≥M≥ ≥C≥O≥M≥P≥A≥T≥I≥B≥I≥L≥I≥T≥YSTYLOGRAPH is fully compatible with the powerful OS-9 operating system. Text prepared using STYLOGRAPH is directly useable by other software. (This significantly aids software development since cursor based editing allows full viewing of the text being worked on thereby reducing errors and decreasing programming time). The size of the file being edited is limited only by the capacity of the disk system. Files may be loaded into the text at any point making it possible to rapidly create made-up documents using portions of text that have been previously saved to a text file. Also, to complement this  feature, any portion of a text may be saved to a text file for use at a later point. The printer output may also be directed to a disk file for later print spooling. Most disk operating system commands are directly accessible without leaving the STYLOGRAPH system.,pp≥C≥O≥M≥P≥L≥E≥T≥E≥ ≥I≥N≥S≥T≥R≥U≥C≥T≥I≥O≥N≥SThe manual is written so that people with little or no experience with computers can easily learn to use STYLOGRAPH in a few hours. A text file is included which demonstrates most of the features of STYLOGRAPH and allows the operator to practice most of the functions. The logical arrangement of the commands and the immediate display of the results greatly simplifies the learning process. The manual also contains instructions for limited modification of STYLOGRAPH for special applications.
