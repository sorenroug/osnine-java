      <title>NOTATION IN THIS MANUAL</title>
      <para>
Throughout this manual, the following notation is used to describe the
format of COBOL statements:
</para>
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
All words printed in capital letters which are underlined must always
be present when the functions of which they are a part are used. An
error printout will occur during compilation if the underlined words
are absent or incorrectly spelled. The underlining is not necessary
when writing a COBOL source program.
</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
All words printed in capital letters which are not underlined are used
for readability only. They may be written, or not, as the programmer wishes.
</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
All words printed in small letters are generic terms representing names
which will be devised by the programmer.
</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
When material is enclosed in braces { } , a choice must be made from
the options within them.
</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
When material is enclosed in square brackets [ ], it is an indication
that the material is an option which may be included or omitted as required.
</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
When material is enclosed in square brackets crossed <arg choice="ansi"> </arg>, it is an
indication that the material is mandatory when the ANSI switch is set
(see Chapter 2) but optional otherwise.
</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
Language features that are shaded in the text are language extensions
which exceed the ANSI standard.
</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
In text, the ellipsis (...) shows the omission of a portion of a source
program or a sequence. This meaning becomes apparent in context.
 </para>
          <para>
In the general formats, the ellipsis represents the position at which
repetition may occur at the user's option. The portion of the format
that may be repeated is determined as follows:
 </para>
          <para>
Given ... in a clause or statement format, scanning right to left,
determine the { or [ immediately to the left of the  ...; continue
scanning right to left and determine the logically matching } or ]; the
... applies to the words between the determined pair of delimiters.
</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
The term identifier means either a data-name or a  subscripted
     data-name. An identifier takes the following form:
</para>
          <para>
          data-name-1              [ ({data-name-2 | literal-1}) ]
</para>
          <para>
data-name-2 or literal-1 must be a positive integer in the range 1
to the number of elements in the table.
</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <para>

Headings are presented in this manual in the following order of importance:

</para>
      <para>
Numbers ten (10) upwards are written in text as numbers, e.g. 12.
</para>
      <para>
The phrase "For documentation purposes only" in the text of this manual
means that the associated coding is accepted syntactically by the Compiler,
but is ignored when producing the object program.

    <title>RUN-TIME ERRORS</title>
    <para>
Run-time error messages are preceded by the name and segment number of
the currently executing intermediate code file.
</para>
    <para>
There are two types of runtime errors:   Recoverable and Fatal.
</para>
    <para>
(a)  Recoverable errors
</para>
    <para>
If the programmer has specified the STATUS clause in the FILE-CONTROL
paragraph of a program error handling is the programmer's responsibility.
This will generally only apply to errors that are not considered fatal
by the operating system. (See <emphasis role="underline">File Status</emphasis> in Chapters 5, 6 and 7)
</para>
    <para>
(b)  Fatal errors
</para>
    <para>
All errors except those above are fatal. They may come from the operating
system or from the run-time system. Fatal errors cause a message to be
output to the console which includes a 3-digit error code and reference to
the COBOL statement subsequent to that in which the error occurred. These
fall into two classes:
</para>
    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>(i)  Exceptions</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
These cover arithmetic overflow, subscript out of range, too many levels of perform nesting.
</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>(ii) I-O errors</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
These exclude those for which STATUS is not selected as above.

      <title>DISK FILES</title>
      <para>
Two extensions are offered by CIS COBOL file processing; these are as follows:
</para>
      <orderedlist spacing="compact">
        <listitem>
          <para>

      </orderedlist>
      <section>
        <title>LINE SEQUENTIAL FILES</title>
        <para>
When LINE SEQUENTIAL ORGANIZATION is specified in the FILE CONTROL
paragraph ORGANIZATION IS entry, the file is treated as consisting of
variable length records separated by the lire delimiter characters.
Trailing spaces in output records are replaced by a record terminator which
is operating system dependent.
</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>RUN TIME INPUT OF FILENAMES</title>
        <para>
The ASSIGNed name in the SELECT statement for a file is processed on
OPENing as follows:
</para>
        <para>
When the INPUT or OUTPUT phrase is specified, execution of OPEN causes
checking of the file names in accordance with the operating system
conventions for opening an input or output file. The full operating system
features for file reallocation and device control are therefore available to
the CIS COBOL program.
</para>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>LOWER CASE CHARACTERS</title>
      <para>
The full alphanumeric lower case a to z is available in CIS COBOL.
Reserved and user word characters are read as their upper case equivalents (A to Z).
</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>HEXADECIMAL VALUES</title>
      <para>
Hexadecimal binary values can be attributed to non-numeric literals in
CIS COBOL by expressing them as X "xx", where x is a hexadecimal character
in the set 0-9, A-F; xx can be repeated up to 120 times, but the number of
hexadecimal digits must be even.
</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>INTERACTIVE DEBUGGING</title>
      <para>
There is a Run-Time Debug Package to provide break-point facilities in
the user's program. Programs may be run from the start until a specified
break-point is reached, when control is passed back to the user. At this
point, data areas may be inspected or changed.
 </para>
      <para>
The Debug package is entered as an option by the user and the user
program is then tested line by line, paragraph by paragraph and so on as
required. The commands to the package can reference procedure statements
and data areas by means of a 4-digit hexadecimal code output by the compiler
against each line of the compilation listing. Powerful macros of commands
can be used to give very sophisticated debugging facilities. The precise
details for using the package vary according to the host operating system
and are described in the appropriate Operating Guide.

The CURSOR IS data-name-1 clause specifies the data-name which will contain
the CRT cursor address as used by ACCEPT statements. Data-name-1 must be
declared in the Working-Storage section as a 4 character item. The
interpretation of the 4 characters is given in the ACCEPT statement description.

COBOL programs not specifically written for compilation as CIS COBOL on
