<para>OS-9 Level One is a versatile multiprogramming/multitasking
operating system for computers utilizing the Motorola 6809
microprocessor,. It is well-suited for a wide range of applications
on 6809 computers of almost any size or complexity.
Its main features are:</para>

<para>This manual is intended to provide the information necessary to
install, maintain, expand, or write assembly-language software for
OS-9 systems. It assumes that the reader is familiar with the 6809
architecture, instruction set, and assembly language.</para>

<title>History And Design Philosophy</title>

<para>OS-9 Level One is one of the products of the BASIC09 Advanced 6809
Programming Language development effort undertaken by Microware and
Motorola from 1978 to 1980. During the course of the project it
became evident that a fairly sophisticated operating system would be
required to support BASIC09 and similar high-performance 6809
software.</para>

<para>OS-9's design was modeled after Bell Telephone
Laboratories' <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> operating system, which is becoming
widely recognized as a standard for mini and micro multiprogramming
operating systems because of its versatility and relatively simple,
yet elegant structure. Even though a <quote>clone</quote> of UNIX for
the 6809 is relatively easy to implement, there are a number of
problems with this approach. UNIX was designed for fairly large-scale
minicomputers (such as large PDP-11s) that have high CPU throughput,
large fast disk storage devices and a static I/O environment. Also,
UNIX is not particularly time or disk-storage efficient, especially
when used with low-cost disk drives.</para>

<para>For these reasons, OS-9 was designed to retain the overall concept
and user interface of UNIX, but its implementation is considerably
different. OS-9's design is tailored to typical microcomputer
performance ranges and operational environments. As an example, OS-9,
unlike UNIX, does not dynamically swap running programs on and off
disk This is because floppy disks and many lower-cost Winchester-type
hard disks are simply too slow to do this efficiently. Instead, OS-9
always keeps running programs in memory and emphasizes more efficient
use of available ROM or RAM.</para>

<para>OS-9 also introduces some important new features that are intended
to make the most of the capabilities of third-generation
microprocessors, such as support of reentrant, position-independent
software that can be shared by several users simultaneously to reduce
overall memory requirements.</para>

<para>Perhaps the most innovative part of OS-9 is its <quote>memory
module</quote> management system, which provides extensive support for
modular software, particularly ROMed software. This will play an
increasingly important role in the future as a method of reducing
software costs. The <quote>memory module</quote> and LINK capabilities of OS-9
permit modules to be automatically identified, linked together,
shared, updated or repaired. Individual modules in ROM which are
defective may be repaired (without reprogramming the ROM) by placing
a <quote>fixed</quote> module, with the same name, but a higher revision number
into memory. Memory modules have many other advantages, for example,
OS-9 can allow several programs to share a common math subroutine
module. The same module could automatically be replaced with a module
containing drivers for a hardware arithmetic processor without any
change to the programs which call the module.</para>

<para>Users experienced with UNIX should have little difficulty adapting
to OS-9. Here are some of the main differences between the two
systems: 
</para>
<orderedlist  numeration="arabic">
<listitem><para>OS-9 is written in 6809 assembly language, not C. This
improves program size and speed characteristics.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>OS-9 was designed for a mixed RAM/ROM microcomputer memory
environment and more effectively supports reentrant,
position-independent code.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>OS-9 introduces the <quote>memory module</quote> concept for
organizing object code with built-in dynamic inter-module linkage.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>OS-9 supports multiple file managers, which are modules that
interface a class of devices to the file system.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><quote>Fork</quote> and <quote>Execute</quote> calls are faster and
more memory efficient than the UNIX equivalents.</para></listitem>

<title>System Hardware Requirements</title>

<para>The OS-9 Operating system consists of building blocks called
memory modules, which are automatically located and linked together
when the system starts up. This makes it extremely easy to
reconfigure the system. For example, reconfiguring the system to
handle additional devices is simply a matter of placing the
corresponding modules into memory. Because OS-9 is so flexible, the
minimum hardware requirements are difficult to define. A bare-bones
LEVEL I system requires 4K of ROM and 2K of RAM, which may be
expanded to 56K RAM.</para>

<para>Shown below are the requirements for a typical OS-9 software
development system. Actual hardware requirements may vary depending
upon the particular application.</para>
<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
<listitem><para>6809 MPU 
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>24K Bytes RAM Memory for Assembly Language Development. 40K
Bytes RAM Memory for High Level Languages such as BASIC09 (RAM Must
Be Contiguous From Address Zero Upward) 
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>4K Bytes of ROM: 2K must be addressed at $F800 - $FFFF, the
other 2K is position-independent and self-locating. Some disk
systems may require three 2K ROMs.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Console terminal and interface using serial, parallel, or
memory mapped video.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Optional printer using serial or parallel interface.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Optional real-time clock hardware.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>I/O device controller addresses can be located anywhere in the
memory space, however it is good practice to place them as high as
possible to maximize RAM expansion capability. Standard
OS-9 packages for computers made by popular
manufacturers usually conform to the system's customary memory map.</para>
